## üê≥ Clair ‚Äî Container Image Vulnerabilities

**Use case:** Periodic scanning of images stored in registries like Harbor or Quay.

- Works as a service (API-based), not a local CLI
- Focuses on *image layer* analysis using CVE databases

**Pros:**

- Designed for registry integration
- Scalable scanning in CI/CD

**Cons:**

- Requires PostgreSQL and setup
- Less suited for dev workstations

---

## üöÄ Trivy ‚Äî Swiss Army Knife for App & Infra Scanning

**By Aqua Security**

Scans:

- Container images
- SBOMs
- IaC (Terraform, Kubernetes)
- Git repos and secrets
- OS & language-specific dependencies

```bash
trivy image nginx
trivy config ./terraform
```

**Pros:**

- Fast, works offline
- Great developer experience
- Supports secrets scanning

**Cons:**

- Registry integration not as tight as Clair
- DB pulled on each run (can be cached)

---

## üß± Checkov ‚Äî Infrastructure Misconfiguration Checker

**By Bridgecrew (Prisma Cloud)**

Finds insecure configurations in:

- Terraform
- CloudFormation
- Kubernetes YAML

```bash
checkov -d ./terraform/
```

**Example Issues Detected:**

- Public S3 buckets
- Open security groups (0.0.0.0/0)
- Unencrypted resources

**Pros:**

- Policy-as-code with custom rule support
- GitHub PR enforcement and CI/CD integration

**Cons:**

- Doesn‚Äôt scan images or packages ‚Äî pair with Trivy or Grype

---

## üêç Grype ‚Äî CVE Scanner with SBOM Support

**By Anchore**

- Scans container images and filesystem layers
- Works great with Syft (SBOM generator)

```bash
grype alpine:3.13
```

**Pros:**

- SBOM-native
- Easy to integrate into CI/CD

**Cons:**

- No IaC or secrets scanning

---

## üîê Falco ‚Äî Runtime Security with Syscall Hooks

**By Sysdig**

Detects:

- Unexpected process spawns
- Mount changes
- Network activity anomalies

Uses custom rules (YAML) and eBPF/syscalls.

```bash
falco -r custom_rules.yaml
```

**Pros:**

- Runtime-level protection
- Open-source and eBPF-compatible

**Cons:**

- Needs kernel support
- Higher learning curve for rule tuning

---

## üïµÔ∏è osquery ‚Äî Host and Container Observability

**Developed by Facebook**

Query your system like a database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM processes WHERE name = 'nginx';
```

Supports live and scheduled queries. Useful for:

- Threat hunting
- Compliance checks
- IR triage

**Pros:**

- Cross-platform
- Well-documented schema

**Cons:**

- Not container-specific
- Requires deployment agent
