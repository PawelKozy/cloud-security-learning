# Cloud Security Learning

## Overview

This repository is a personal space for experimenting with cloud security concepts across multiple platforms. It organizes notes and reusable scripts for reference.

## Structure

- **AWS/** – service examples and experiments
- **Azure/** – service examples and experiments
- **GCP/** – service examples and experiments
- **containers/** – Kubernetes and Docker materials

The repository focuses on the major cloud providers along with container
security examples. Legacy directories for DevSecOps topics and automation have
been removed to simplify the layout.

Service folders now share a common layout containing `detection/`, `attack/`,
`config/`, and a `notes.md` file for quick references. Additional `scripts/` or
`notes/` directories may appear where more detailed examples are provided.

## Topics

This repo covers various services including:

- AWS (IAM, S3, Lambda, ECR, CloudTrail, Secrets Manager)
- Azure (Azure AD, Sentinel, Logic Apps, Functions, Defender for Cloud)
- GCP (IAM, GCS, Cloud Logging)
- Container security with Kubernetes and Docker
