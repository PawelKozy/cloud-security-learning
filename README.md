# ☁️ cloud-security-learning

**cloud-security-learning** is a structured knowledge base and hands-on reference built from practical experience across cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), container security (Docker, Kubernetes), and detection engineering practices.

This repository captures real-world learning, adversary emulation results, and research-driven notes from building and validating detections, conducting incident response, and exploring cloud-native security controls.

## 🎯 Goal

To consolidate high-impact, technically accurate, and opinionated learning artifacts that reflect practical security engineering work in:

- 🔐 Cloud security (identity and access hardening, secure configuration, logging and monitoring practices)
- ⚙️ Infrastructure security (host and container hardening, runtime analysis, and system-level observability)
- 🛡️ Detection engineering (tuned logic, adversary realism, edge-case handling, and response automation)
- 🧪 Purple teaming & emulation-driven detection building to close visibility and coverage gaps

This repository serves both as a **portfolio of work** and a **living reference** for applied cloud security knowledge — grounded in real scenarios faced during detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response.

## 📦 What’s Inside?

Directory structure mirrors the domains covered:

```
cloudsec-repo/
├── AWS/
│   └── IAM/, ECR/, EC2/...
├── Azure/
│   └── Sentinel/, Logic-Apps/, Defender/...
├── GCP/
│   └── IAM/, GCS/...
├── Containers/
│   ├── Docker/
│   └── Kubernetes/
└── learning-log.md
```

Each product or service is broken down into:

- `attacks/` → hands-on TTPs & lab reconstructions
- `detection/` → detection logic, notes, and considerations
- `config/` → hardening examples and secure defaults
- `notes.md` → walkthroughs, best practices, and curated insights

## 🔍 Scope and Focus

This repository is a living, evolving workspace built to sharpen cloud and infrastructure security skills — with an emphasis on hands-on learning, real-world misconfiguration analysis, and defense-in-depth design.

The focus aligns with responsibilities typically expected of infrastructure and cloud security engineers:

- Implementing secure-by-default configurations across cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Designing layered defenses around identity, secrets, workloads, and network boundaries
- Investigating runtime behavior and securing containerized systems (Kubernetes, Docker)
- Enforcing least privilege through IAM, policies, and cluster RBAC
- Building and validating threat scenarios to test assumptions and visibility gaps
- Documenting secure patterns and response-ready configurations (e.g., hardening templates, baseline policies)

This is not a finished portfolio — but a security engineering journal in motion.

## 🚧 What's Next

Upcoming additions will focus on:

- Strengthening real-world hardening references for IAM, Kubernetes, and cloud workloads
- Improving coverage of secrets lifecycle and secure system bootstrapping
- Showcasing end-to-end patterns for building, securing, and validating cloud-native systems

This direction is shaped by what’s valuable in production, not what’s trendy in training.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project values:

- 📚 *Learning through doing* — test, break, and reassemble
- 🧩 *Context over checklist* — focus on **why** something matters
- 🛠️ *Clarity over complexity* — simplified, not simplistic
- 📈 *Continuous iteration* — nothing is final, everything evolves
