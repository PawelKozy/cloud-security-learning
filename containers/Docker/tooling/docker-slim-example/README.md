# docker-slim Example

This directory demonstrates a basic container optimized with `docker-slim`.

* `before.Dockerfile` – original Dockerfile for a simple Python app.
* `after.Dockerfile` – resulting Dockerfile after slimming.
* `before-after.diff` – diff showing changes made during optimization.
* `seccomp.json` – example seccomp profile generated by `docker-slim`.

Run `docker-slim build --include-path /app` to reproduce and inspect the
output artifacts.
